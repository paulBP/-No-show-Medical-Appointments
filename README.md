# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-No-show-Medical-Appointments

In this project, I'll analyze a medical appointment dataset and find out important factors that affect patient's no-show for their appointment. I'll first assess and clean up the data for easy analysis. Then I'll do exploratory data analysis(EDA) to understand the variables and the relationships between variables and visualize the results. This dataset collects information from more than 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

Questions Under Investigation:

- What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for
- Their scheduled appointment or not ?
- Is there any relationship between age and patients who showed-up or not ?;
- Is the Gender of the patient an important factor to predict if a patient will show up or not ?
- Does the fact of receiving an sms an important indicator to predict if a patient will show up
